# KickStarter Analysis
## Project Overview
##### Background
We are conducting an analysis of crowdfunding campaigns to help Louise conduct her own as an upcoming playwright. She needs help in regards to establishing what works and what doesn't and is eager to start her own crowdfunding site to fund her new play, "*Fever*". 

##### Purpose
We want to do an analysis of crowdfunding campaigns and sort which ones were successful and which were not. Among those, we want to uncover trends of successful crowdfunding campaigns and mirror specific factors that make certain campaigns successful.

## Analysis
##### Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis was performed by creating a pivot table using crowdfunding Kickstarter raw data of Parent Categories against the dates the campaigns were created. We placed filters on the two to specifically measure the data among theater campaigns against the months through out the year. We took outcome count values of the Kickstarter raw data and filtered them accordingly in the pivot table to show the number of campaigns in that specific filter that were successful, failed, or canceled, as well as a grand total. We then created a line chart according to the data from the pivot table to outline the trend across the months in the year. Our findings were that a high number of campaigns were rose to success during the month of April and peaked during May. The trend slows down as the summer comes, with winter following the same downtrend suite. There could be a number of reasons to speculate the sucess of theater campaigns, one could be the weather.
