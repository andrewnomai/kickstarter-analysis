# KickStarter Analysis
## Project Overview
##### Background
We are conducting an analysis of crowdfunding campaigns to help Louise conduct her own as an upcoming playwright. She needs help in regards to establishing what works and what doesn't and is eager to start her own crowdfunding site to fund her new play, >*Fever*. 

##### Purpose
We want to do an analysis of crowdfunding campaigns and sort which ones were successful and which were not. Among those, we want to uncover trends of successful crowdfunding campaigns and mirror specific factors that make certain campaigns successful.
